<!-- Create a React Frontend: Develop a user-friendly chat interface using React where users can input their messages and receive responses from the AI model.

Integrate AI Model: Use the provided example Python file to communicate with the AI model. Messages from the frontend should be sent to the AI model, and the responses should be displayed back to the user in the chat interface.

Implement Message Limit and Login System: Limit the number of messages a user can send to 25. Optionally, you can implement a simple login system to track users' messages.

Bonus Points - Incorporate Whisper STT and Silero TTS: If you want to earn brownie points, consider integrating the Whisper Speech-to-Text (STT) system for voice input and Silero Text-to-Speech (TTS) for generating AI model responses as voice output. -->
